Description: 
CEB, a package for the integration of single-cell multi-omics data for celltype identification.
In CEB, we use four state-of-the-art cell-type identification methods to obtain the base partitions of single-cell multi-omics data, and then they are integrated  by CSPA to obtain the final cell-type results.
CEB allows users to cluster the data with different clustering methods, and it is able to integrate single-cell multi-omics data.
